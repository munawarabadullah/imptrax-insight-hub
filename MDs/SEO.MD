Website Structure & Technical Foundations
These rules focus on the underlying technical elements and overall organization of the website. Ensure search engines can efficiently crawl, index, and understand the content.

Submit an XML sitemap. Provide an XML sitemap to Google Search Console to help search engines discover all important URLs.
Monitor and fix crawl errors. Regularly inspect Google Search Console for reported crawl errors (e.g., 404 "Not Found" pages, 5xx server errors) and address them promptly.
Ensure technical accessibility. Check that nothing is preventing Google from showing the site in search results.
Ensure Google sees the page like a user. Give Google's crawlers access to the same resources as a user's browser (e.g., CSS and JavaScript).
Use the URL Inspection Tool. Check how Google sees a page using the URL Inspection Tool in Search Console.
Opt-out of search results. If desired, prevent certain pages or the entire site from appearing in search results using appropriate methods.
Configure important pages for indexing. Ensure all important web pages are eligible for inclusion in Google's search index.

Ensure proper meta tag usage. Use meta tags effectively to accurately describe page content to search engines.
Track and improve Core Web Vitals. Continuously monitor and strive for improvement in Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
Avoid Flash technology. Ensure the website does not incorporate Flash.
Verify mobile text readability. Check that text content is easily readable on mobile devices without requiring zooming.
Rename raw image and video files descriptively. Use descriptive names that reflect content or target keywords (e.g., modern-planters.jpg instead of IMG_3294.jpg).
Organize the site logically. Structure the site in a logical way to help search engines and users understand how pages relate.
Group similar pages in directories. For larger sites, organize content into directories to help Google understand content changes and crawl frequencies.
Reduce duplicate content. Avoid showing the same content under different URLs; specify a canonical version if duplicates exist.
Use redirects or rel="canonical". Set up redirects from non-preferred URLs to the best representative URL, or use rel="canonical" for similar content.
Implement breadcrumb navigation. Utilize breadcrumbs to help users understand their current location within the website's hierarchy.
