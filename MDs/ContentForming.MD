Use web search to identify the top 10 ranking pages for KEYWORD. Analyze their content structure, headings, and key points covered.~
Based on the analysis, create a detailed outline with at least 15 headings and subheadings (H1, H2, H3, H4) that comprehensively cover TOPIC. Ensure the outline has a logical flow and addresses key user intents.~
Research and list 10-15 related long-tail keywords and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) terms relevant to TOPIC. Plan to naturally incorporate these throughout the article.~
Craft an engaging, SEO-optimized title (H1) that includes KEYWORD and appeals to AUDIENCE. Ensure it's under 60 characters for optimal display in search results.~
Write a compelling introduction (150-200 words) that hooks the reader, introduces TOPIC, and outlines what the article will cover. Naturally include KEYWORD.~
For each main section (H2) in the outline:
1. Write 300-500 words of in-depth, informative content.
2. Include relevant examples, data, or case studies found through web search.
3. Naturally incorporate 1-2 related long-tail keywords or LSI terms.
4. Ensure a conversational tone that speaks directly to AUDIENCE.
5. Add a unique insight or perspective not commonly found in competing articles.~
Create 2-3 custom images, diagrams, or infographic concepts that visually explain key points in the article. Describe each in detail, including alt text optimized for KEYWORD.~
Write a "Quick Takeaways" or "Key Points" section that summarizes the main insights of the article in 5-7 bullet points.~
Develop a conclusion (200-250 words) that summarizes the key points, reinforces the main message, and includes a call-to-action relevant to AUDIENCE.~
Create 5 unique, relevant FAQs related to TOPIC. Ensure answers are concise yet informative, and naturally include long-tail keywords.~
Write a custom message asking for reader feedback and encouraging social shares. Include a question to boost engagement.~
Use web search to identify 3-5 authoritative external sources relevant to TOPIC. Create in-text citations and a "References" section at the end of the article.~
Review the entire article to ensure optimal keyword density (aim for 1-2% for KEYWORD), proper use of headings, and inclusion of long-tail keywords. Check that the content maintains high perplexity and burstiness while staying on topic.~
Format the article using Markdown, ensuring all headings (H1, H2, H3, H4) and important points are properly styled. Bold key phrases and use italics for emphasis where appropriate.~
Compile the full article, including the title, introduction, main body with all sections, images, conclusion, FAQs, engagement message, and references. Ensure it meets or exceeds WORDCOUNT while maintaining high-quality, engaging content throughout.
