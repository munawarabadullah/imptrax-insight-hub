This blueprint provides a concise, actionable guide to optimizing your website and its individual pages for enhanced search engine visibility and user experience. Each rule is designed for direct implementation, focusing on practical steps to improve your online presence.

I. Website Structure & Technical Foundations

These rules focus on the underlying technical elements and overall organization of your website, ensuring search engines can efficiently crawl, index, and understand your content.
Create and optimize robots.txt: Guide search engine crawlers on which sections of your site to access or avoid.1
Submit an XML sitemap: Provide an XML sitemap to Google Search Console to help search engines discover all important URLs on your website.1
Monitor and fix crawl errors: Regularly inspect Google Search Console for reported crawl errors (e.g., 404 "Not Found" pages, 5xx server errors) and address them promptly to ensure accessibility.1
Ensure technical accessibility: Check that nothing is preventing Google from showing your site in search results by ensuring technical requirements are met.6
Ensure Google sees your page like a user: Provide Google's crawlers access to the same resources as a user's browser (e.g., CSS and JavaScript) so Google understands your pages fully.1
Use the URL Inspection Tool: Check how Google sees your page using the URL Inspection Tool in Search Console.1
Opt-out of search results: If desired, prevent certain pages or your entire site from appearing in search results using appropriate methods.1
Configure important pages for indexing: Ensure all important web pages are eligible for inclusion in Google's search index.1
Secure your website with HTTPS: Encrypt user data with HTTPS to build trust and gain a minor ranking advantage.2
Enhance page loading performance: Continuously work to improve page loading times by compressing images, minifying code (CSS, JavaScript, HTML), and streamlining existing code structures.3
Implement a responsive design: Ensure your website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations, prioritizing mobile users.3
Employ noindex meta tags: Use noindex for pages with thin content or low value to conserve crawl budget and direct search engine attention to more important content.2
Consolidate duplicate URLs: Utilize 301 redirects or rel="canonical" tags to prevent search engines from being confused by multiple versions of the same content.1
Optimize JavaScript SEO: Address fundamental aspects of optimizing JavaScript-heavy websites for search engine crawlability and rendering.12
Ensure proper meta tag usage: Use meta tags effectively to accurately describe page content to search engines.12
Track and improve Core Web Vitals: Continuously monitor and strive for improvement in Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).2
Avoid Flash technology: Ensure your website does not incorporate Flash, as it hinders mobile-friendliness and accessibility.8
Verify mobile text readability: Check that text content is easily readable on mobile devices without requiring users to zoom or pinch.8
Rename raw image and video files descriptively: Use descriptive names that reflect content or target keywords (e.g., modern-planters.jpg instead of IMG_3294.jpg).6
Organize your site logically: Structure your site in a logical way to help search engines and users understand how your pages relate.6
Group similar pages in directories: For larger sites, organize content into directories (folders) to help Google understand content changes and crawl frequencies.6
Reduce duplicate content: Avoid showing the same content under different URLs; specify a canonical version if duplicates exist.1
Use redirects or rel="canonical": Set up redirects from non-preferred URLs to the best representative URL, or use rel="canonical" for similar content.6
Implement breadcrumb navigation: Utilize breadcrumbs to help users understand their current location within the website's hierarchy and improve site structure.7
